# Notes

## Overview

The Notes App is a note-taking application developed for WatchOS using Swift 5.0. It leverages WatchOS' local storage capabilities, ensuring that notes are persisted even when the watch is turned off or the app is closed. The app boasts a range of features including fancy yet simple animations, a consistent color palette, and support for various input methods such as drawing, voice, and typing. Additionally, the app implements robust state management throughout its interface.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes WatchOS' local storage to persist notes across app sessions.
- **Fancy Animations**: Incorporates smooth and visually appealing animations to enhance the user experience.
- **Consistent Color Palette**: Adheres to a unified color scheme throughout the app for a cohesive aesthetic.
- **Multiple Input Methods** (WatchOS 5):
  - **Voice**: Supports voice input for quickly dictating notes.
  - **Typing**: Allows users to input notes via the watch's keyboard.
  - **Doodle-to-Text**: Users can sketch letters or shapes directly on the screen, which are then intelligently converted into text.
- **State Management**: Implements a state management mechanisms to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift 5.0**: The primary programming language for WatchOS app development.
- **WatchOS 10.2**: The operating system platform for Apple Watch devices.
- **Core Data**: Utilized for local storage and data persistence.
- **WatchKit**: Apple's framework for developing user interfaces for Apple Watch apps.
- **Speech Recognition**: Incorporates Apple's speech recognition APIs for voice input.

## How It Works

1. **Input Methods**:
   - Users can draw notes on the watch face, which are converted into text using handwriting recognition.
   - Alternatively, they can dictate notes using voice input.
   - Typing notes using the watch's keyboard is also supported.
2. **Storage**:
   - Notes are stored locally on the watch using Core Data, ensuring persistence across app sessions.
3. **Animations**:
   - Fancy animations are incorporated throughout the app to provide a visually appealing user experience.
4. **State Management**:
   - The app employs robust state management mechanisms to handle user interactions and maintain responsiveness.
